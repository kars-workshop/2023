An intelligent assistant shall be an agent that knows you and the world, 
can receive your requests or predict your needs, and provide you the 
right services at the right time with your permission. As smart devices 
such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Meta Ray-ban Stories get popular, 
Intelligent Assistants are gradually playing an important role in 
people's lives. The Emergence of AR/VR devices brings more opportunities 
and calls for the next generation of Intelligent Assistants.
In this talk, we discuss the many challenges and opportunities we face 
to grow intelligent assistants from server-side to on-device, from 
voice-only to multi-modal, from context-agnostic to context-aware, and 
from listening to the users' requests to predicting the user's needs. We 
also describe the roles public and personal knowledge graphs play to 
empower such an assistant. We expect these new challenges to open doors 
to new research areas and start a new chapter for providing personal 
assistance services.
