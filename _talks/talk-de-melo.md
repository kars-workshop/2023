In our complex modern world, we increasingly rely on automated systems
to guide us in our decision-making. Intelligent recommender systems
require knowledge about the users and about potential items of interest,
but can also benefit from various sorts of background knowledge, e.g.,
how different human activities relate to one another. In this talk, I
discuss several methods to bring together these various kinds of
knowledge by means of knowledge graphs and neuro-symbolic explainable
AI. Such methods draw on deep reinforcement learning or neural logic
reasoning to provide explanations that allow users to better understand
why particular items are being recommended. I will also discuss our work
on how to mitigate bias and enable dialogue-based interaction in
conversational recommender systems, along with datasets and code that we
have released to promote further research on these topics.
