The purpose of the **Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems (KaRS) Workshop** is to provide a meeting forum for stimulating and disseminating research in Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems, where researchers can network and discuss their research results in an informal way.

The **5th Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems (KaRS) Workshop** focuses on all aspects related to the exploitation of external and **explicit knowledge** sources to feed and build a recommendation engine, and on the adoption of interactions based on the **conversational paradigm**. The aim is to go beyond the traditional accuracy goal and to start a new generation of algorithms and approaches with the help of the methodological diversity embodied in fields such as **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Information Retrieval (IR)** and **Information Systems (IS)**. Consequently the focus lies on works improving the user experience and following goals such as user engagement and satisfaction or customer value.

KaRS 2023 is the 5th edition of the Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems (KaRS) Workshop. It will take place from September the 18th to September the 22nd, 2023 in conjunction with ACM RecSys 2023, Singapore.
